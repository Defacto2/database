Initially couriers (people who transferred warez between sites) had to use a server-client-server method. Whereby they downloaded a copy of a file to their working computer and then uploaded it to the destination FTP server. To do this at any reasonable speed the courier required access to a fast and for the time expensive internet connection. This meant mostly only IT professionals, university students or the rich could play this role. But FXP allowed direct FTP server to FTP servers file transfers which made the speed of the courier's local connection mostly irrelevant. It allowed almost anyone to trade software between FTP sites and completely diminished the worth of couriers.","2014-02-04 17:00:52","2015-04-21 00:16:15"
