# Defacto2 Data Exports

### Current data dump: 15-Jan-2019

A complete **data dump** of the [Defacto2](https://defacto2.net) database for its file collection, web links and group acronyms.

#### What is here

The data export is available in two formats, SQL and JSON.

SQL allows you to recreate the database using a MySQL 5.7 server installation.

- `defacto2-inno-2019-01-15-16-10-18.sql`

JSON is a modern, widely used standard that you can incorporate into applications.

- `files-2019-01-15-16-15-57.json`
- `groups-2019-01-15-16-16-16.json`
- `netresources-2019-01-15-16-16-28.json`

- `files-2019-01-15-16-15-57.min.json` is identical to `files-2019-01-15-16-15-57.json` except the newline characters have been removed, the minification was done with [Minify](https://github.com/tdewolff/minify/tree/master/cmd/minify)

**Please read and adhere to the licence before using this data in any projects**

Enjoy, [Defacto2](https://defacto2.net).

#### Licence

The data and these exports are under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) licence.

#### How to use the SQL

You need a preconfigured and running database server that can handle MySQL 5.7 syntax.

- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.7.html) 5.7 Community Server
- [Percona Server](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.7/index.html) 5.7 is a drop in replacement for MySQL 5.7
- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com) 10.2+ is a drop in replacement for MySQL 5.7

In a terminal use the MySQL client to import the data:

`mysql -u root < defacto2-inno-2019-01-15-16-10-18.sql`

- `-u root` is the mysql sign-in account name
- `< defacto2-inno-2019-01-15-16-10-18.sql` tells mysql to import the data from the .sql file

I recommend using [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org) for data browsing and management.

Though [DBeaver Community](https://dbeaver.io) also works fine.

#### Datasets

The data is broken down into three tables, `files`, `groups` and `netresources`

- `files` form the core of the site and compose of nearly 18,000 rows of hosted data.
- `groups` comprise of only initialisms and acronyms for scene groups.
- `netresources` are online links to other scene resources, usually websites.
