# Defacto2 Data Exports

This is a nearly complete **data dump** taken during April of 2015 from our database that is used in conjunction with [defacto2.net](https://defacto2.net).

The collection of exports comes in 5 free and open formats.
* `JSON` *JavaScript Object Notation* a standard and modern format often used by web applications.
* `XML` *Extensible Markup Language* a standard but verbose format.
* `ODS` *Open Document Spreadsheet Format* used in many modern spreadsheet applications such as [Apache OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/), [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) and [Microsoft Excel 2010](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-Excel-to-open-or-save-a-worksheet-in-the-OpenDocument-Spreadsheet-ods-format-c7114baa-f08a-49eb-aefd-f5d61ed347cd)+.
* `CVS` *comma-separated values* contain only raw data but can be imported by most spreadsheets and databases. 
* `YML` a derivative of `JSON` that has improved formatting for human readability.

All the formats except `ODS` are text based are viewable in a text editor or web browser.

*Export updates will be infrequent except when there are large collections of new files placed on the website.*
